## Simple docker file for jenkins with docker inside
Dockerfile for Jenkins with Docker inside

### About
I was planning to run many application like python projects 
and other in Docker on Jenkins using Jenkinsfiles to automate delivery.
I didn't expect that I face so many issued only 
because I decided run Jenkins on Windows instead of Linux.

The last problem overflowing bitterness was problem with dockers.

As solution I found jenkins-withdocker, but It was still not perfect.
This docker images are not up to date when you use global docker repository 
(it have to be rebuild everytime when Jenkins release new version). 
It cause requirement to manual plugin installation 
and solving problems with plugins security after jenkins version upgrade, etc. 

#### Reason
I created this repository to be able setup docker in the future 
with simple steps described in this README.

##### Why Jenkins on windows in docker?
Jenkins on windows have problems with: 
- running Jenkinsfiles  (error like: [Error response from daemon: the working directory ... is invalid, it needs to be an absolute path.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48390638/11318366))
- [wsl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) 
- supporting [dockers](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50857) and many other tickets

I spent too much time on solving integration between windows, wsl and docker, configuration, etc. 

#### Solution
The best solution turned out to be use Docker image with Jenkins with Docker inside. 

So as solution I created simple Dockerfile (source [jenkins-withdocker](https://github.com/getintodevops/jenkins-withdocker/blob/master/Dockerfile)) and README about how to setup a docker with jenkins (with docker inside) locally on Windows.

# Installation
## Docker on Windows
### Requirements:
- CPU Virtualization enabled (read below)
- Create account on docker.com (required to start docker - it allows to publish private docker image to repository - not needed but account is required)

### Instruction and detail: 
[Install docker on windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

#### In short steps:
1. Download docker installer [Docker Desktop Installer.exe](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe)
2. Follow the install wizard
3. Click Finish

#### CPU Virtualization
In order to run docker CPU Virtualization must be enabled. You can enable it in BIOS.
Check if virtualization [is enabled](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)

## Build docker image and run
- Checkout this repository or copy Dockerfile to any location
- Open Command Prompt (Win+R, typ cmd)
- Go to place with Dockerfile
- Build docker container:
```bash
$ docker build
```
or 
```bash
$ docker build -f {path_to_Dockerfile_file}
```
- Find build docker
```bash
$ docker container ls
```
- Copy docker Container ID 
- Run docker. E.g.\
`docker run -d -v "D:/Jenkins_docker":/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins 2535364c7a3e`
Where:\
`D:/Jenkins_docker` - place where jenkins will be installed (configuration + workspace)
`2535364c7a3e` - example copied docker container ID

### Stopping docker
```bash
$ docker container stop 2535364c7a3e
```

Where:
`2535364c7a3e` - example copied docker container ID
### Running created container
```bash
$ docker container start 2535364c7a3e
```

### Removing container and image
Find CONTAINER ID and IMAGE
```bash
docker container ls
```

E.g.:
```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                              NAMES
2535364c7a3e        3f56b90c6bb8        "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:50000->50000/tcp   jenkins
```
##### Stop container
```bash
$ docker container stop 2535364c7a3e
```
##### Remove container
Stopping and removing container is required to be able rebuild docker (container)
```bash
$ docker container rm 2535364c7a3e
```
 ##### Remove image
```bash
$ docker image rm 3f56b90c6bb8
``` 

## Jenkins configuration
After [Running created container](Running created container) Jenkins is starting up

Open webbrowser and type address `localhost:8080` and follow installation

The `/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword` file is located under mounted place. e.g. in my case it is `D:/Jenkins_docker/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
(`/var/jenkins_home` is "mapped" to `D:/Jenkins_docker`)

### Other config
- add jenkins user
- install plugin (select None)

### Blue ocean
- After installation go to Jenkins Settings 
- add `Blue ocean` plugin 
- select Jenkins restart after installation option 

#### Testing
- Open Blue Ocean view (icon on the left)
- Click Add new Pipeline
- TODO
